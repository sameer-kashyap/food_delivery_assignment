# 🍔 Food Delivery Dataset Cleaning & Error Prevention  
### Data Quality & Governance Assignment

This project simulates a real-world **food delivery platform dataset** (Zomato/Swiggy-style) and focuses on identifying potential data quality issues before they impact business decisions.

Instead of only creating a dataset, this assignment emphasizes **data thinking** — anticipating how real-world data breaks and designing preventive validation strategies.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To demonstrate:

- Field-level documentation
- Error anticipation
- Data validation design
- Data governance awareness
- Cleaning & prevention strategies

The goal was not just dataset creation, but **proactive data quality management**.

---

## 📄 Dataset Context

The dataset simulates food delivery orders including details such as:

- Order ID
- Customer Information
- Restaurant Details
- Delivery Time
- Order Amount
- Payment Method
- Ratings
- Location Data

The structure mimics real operational systems used in food delivery platforms.

---

## 🚫 Identified Data Issues

The project documents common real-world data problems such as:

- Duplicate Order IDs
- Missing values
- Outliers (e.g., unrealistic delivery times)
- Inconsistent date formats
- Typos in categorical fields
- Incorrect data types
- Invalid payment method entries
- Negative or extreme order amounts

Each issue is paired with recommended prevention logic.

---

## 🛠️ Data Cleaning & Prevention Strategies

- Data validation rules in Excel
- Drop-down controlled categorical fields
- Format standardization
- Duplicate detection methods
- Threshold checks for outliers
- Structured documentation of each field
- Governance recommendations for production systems
